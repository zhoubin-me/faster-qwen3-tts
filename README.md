# Faster Qwen3-TTS

Real-time Qwen3-TTS inference using CUDA graph capture. No Flash Attention, no vLLM, no Triton. Just `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph`. Supports both streaming and non-streaming generation.

## Results

Benchmarks include tokenization + inference (apples-to-apples with baseline). RTF > 1.0 = faster than real-time. TTFA measured as time to first playable audio chunk using streaming (chunk_size=8).

### 1.7B Model

| GPU | Baseline RTF | Baseline TTFA | CUDA Graphs RTF | CUDA Graphs TTFA | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Jetson AGX Orin 64GB | 0.130 | 2,594ms | 1.27 | 650ms | 9.8x / 4.0x |
| Jetson Thor | 0.772 | 912ms | 1.26 | 595ms | 1.6x / 1.5x |
| DGX Spark (GB10) | 1.43 | 28,539ms | 1.91 | 373ms | 1.3x / 76.5x |
| RTX 4090 | 1.32 | 468ms | **4.85** | **170ms** | 3.7x / 2.8x |
| H100 80GB HBM3 | 0.59 | 1,045ms | **3.98** | **236ms** | 6.7x / 4.4x |

**Note:** Baseline TTFA values are **streaming TTFA** from the community `Qwen3-TTS-streaming` fork (which adds streaming). The official `Qwen3-TTS` repo does **not** currently support streaming, so its “TTFA” is effectively **time-to-full-audio**. With RTF near 1.0, that means waiting for the entire sentence/paragraph to finish speaking before you hear anything. CUDA graphs uses `generate_voice_clone_streaming(chunk_size=8)` for TTFA. Both include text tokenization for fair comparison. Speedup shows throughput / TTFA improvement. The streaming fork reports additional speedups that appear tied to `torch.compile`; we couldn’t reproduce those on Jetson-class devices where `torch.compile` isn’t available. **DGX Spark baseline values were re-measured with `benchmarks/baseline.py` (no streaming), so TTFA there is time-to-full-audio.**


**GPU architecture notes:** RTX 4090 (2.5 GHz clocks) outperforms H100 (1.8 GHz) for single-stream workloads. H100's lower baseline (RTF 0.59 vs 4090's 1.34) reflects design optimization for batch processing rather than single-stream inference.

## Parity

We maintain parity with upstream Qwen3‑TTS in two layers, and document where (and why) the fast path can differ numerically. When we say **Qwen3TTS vs FasterQwen3TTS**, we are comparing the upstream dynamic‑cache path against our static‑cache CUDA‑graph path.

- **Fast path (static cache + CUDA graphs):** Streaming and non‑streaming share the same decode core and match upstream for the initial window where artifacts are most audible. Tests enforce this prefix parity deterministically.
- **Parity mode (dynamic cache, tests only):** A dynamic‑cache decode path (no CUDA graphs) that calls `talker.generate(...)` is used in tests to prove exact token‑level equality against upstream for all model types.

**Why can static cache differ from dynamic cache?** The math is equivalent, but the kernel path is not. Static cache uses a fixed max‑length KV buffer and an explicit attention mask, which often selects a different SDPA kernel than the dynamic cache path (shorter K/V, `is_causal=True`, mask‑free). In BF16/TF32, different kernel/reduction orders are not bit‑exact, so the outputs can differ slightly even when the algorithm is the same.

**Parity streaming note:** The dynamic‑cache parity streaming path is intentionally slow. On an RTX 4090 it measured ~0.77s TTFA (chunk_size=8) and ~1.17s TTFA (chunk_size=12), versus ~0.16–0.18s TTFA in the fast CUDA‑graph path. Use parity streaming only for validation, not performance.

Tests live in `tests/test_e2e_parity.py` and cover:

- Voice clone (x‑vector) prefix parity vs upstream
- Streaming vs non‑streaming parity (fast path)
- CustomVoice full equality (parity mode)
- VoiceDesign full equality (parity mode)
- Voice clone ICL full equality (parity mode)

You can control the model IDs used by tests via environment variables:

```
QWEN_TTS_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base
QWEN_TTS_CUSTOM_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice
QWEN_TTS_VOICE_DESIGN_MODEL=Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign
```

### Quality Comparison: Qwen3TTS vs FasterQwen3TTS

We provide side‑by‑side audio samples to compare **Qwen3TTS** (dynamic cache) against **FasterQwen3TTS** (static cache) for both CustomVoice and ICL/voice‑clone. The algorithms are equivalent, but the kernels and reduction order differ, so results are not bit‑identical; the samples let you judge the perceptual impact directly. All samples use the **1.7B** models and cap generation at ~14 seconds so the model can finish naturally.

## Demo UI

A minimal web UI that streams audio in real time and shows TTFA and RTF live:

```bash
pip install -e ".[demo]"
python demo/server.py --model Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base
# open http://localhost:7860
```

Features: voice clone (upload any WAV), voice design (1.7B-VoiceDesign model), streaming/non-streaming toggle, adjustable chunk size, live TTFA/RTF metrics, WAV download.


## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/andimarafioti/faster-qwen3-tts
cd faster-qwen3-tts
./setup.sh       # creates venv with uv, installs deps, downloads models
./benchmark.sh   # runs full benchmark, saves JSON + audio samples
```

Requires: Python 3.10+, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).

### Install (PyPI)

```bash
pip install faster-qwen3-tts
```

Note: This installs the `qwen-tts` PyPI package (`>=0.1.1`).

Install from source:

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### Benchmark a specific model

```bash
./benchmark.sh 0.6B
./benchmark.sh 1.7B
./benchmark.sh both   # default
```

Results are saved as `bench_results_<GPU_NAME>.json` and audio samples as `sample_0.6B.wav` / `sample_1.7B.wav`.

## How It Works

Qwen3-TTS runs two autoregressive transformers per decode step:
1. **Talker** (28 layers): generates the first codebook token from text
2. **Code Predictor** (5 layers): generates 15 additional codebook tokens

A single step involves ~500 small CUDA kernel launches with Python overhead between them. The GPU spends more time waiting for the next kernel than computing.

CUDA graphs capture the entire decode step and replay it as a single GPU operation:

1. **Static KV cache**: pre-allocated fixed-size tensors (no dynamic allocation)
2. **Model's own forward**: SDPA + RoPE via the model's native attention layers
3. **Graph capture**: `torch.cuda.CUDAGraph` for both predictor and talker
4. **Padded attention**: attention mask handles variable-length KV within fixed buffers

### Per-component breakdown (Jetson AGX Orin, 0.6B)

| Component | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| Talker (28 layers) | 75ms | 12ms |
| Predictor (15 steps) | 190ms | 26ms |
| Overhead | 65ms | 16ms |
| **Total per step** | **330ms** | **54ms** |

## Streaming

CUDA graphs support streaming output — audio chunks are yielded during generation with the same per-step performance as non-streaming mode.

### Chunk size vs performance (Jetson AGX Orin, 0.6B)

| chunk_size | TTFA | RTF | Audio per chunk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 240ms | 0.750 | 83ms |
| 2 | 266ms | 1.042 | 167ms |
| 4 | 362ms | 1.251 | 333ms |
| 8 | 556ms | 1.384 | 667ms |
| 12 | 753ms | 1.449 | 1000ms |
| Non-streaming | — | 1.57 | all at once |

Smaller chunks = lower latency but more decode overhead. `chunk_size=2` is the smallest that stays real-time on Jetson.

**Model mode parity:** In hot-path (post CUDA-graph capture) runs, the different model modes are effectively the same speed. Use `benchmarks/compare_modes.py` to reproduce. Example on 0.6B, `chunk_size=8`:

| Mode | TTFA (ms) | RTF | ms/step |
| ---- | --------- | --- | ------- |
| VoiceClone xvec | 152 ± 11 | 5.470 ± 0.032 | 15.2 ± 0.1 |
| VoiceClone full ICL | 149 ± 1 | 5.497 ± 0.026 | 15.2 ± 0.1 |
| CustomVoice | 148 ± 1 | 5.537 ± 0.020 | 15.0 ± 0.1 |

### Usage

```python
from faster_qwen3_tts import FasterQwen3TTS

model = FasterQwen3TTS.from_pretrained("Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-0.6B-Base")

# Streaming — yields audio chunks during generation
for audio_chunk, sr, timing in model.generate_voice_clone_streaming(
    text="Hello world!", language="English",
    ref_audio="ref.wav", ref_text="...",
    chunk_size=8,  # 8 steps ≈ 667ms of audio per chunk
):
    play(audio_chunk, sr)  # process/send each chunk immediately

# Non-streaming — returns all audio at once (unchanged API)
audio_list, sr = model.generate_voice_clone(
    text="Hello world!", language="English",
    ref_audio="ref.wav", ref_text="...",
)
```

### CLI

Voice cloning (reference audio):

```bash
faster-qwen3-tts clone \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-Base \
  --text "Hello world!" \
  --language English \
  --ref-audio ref.wav \
  --ref-text "Reference transcript" \
  --output out.wav
```

CustomVoice (predefined speaker IDs):

```bash
faster-qwen3-tts custom --model Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice --list-speakers
faster-qwen3-tts custom \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice \
  --speaker aiden \
  --text "Hello!" \
  --language English \
  --output out.wav
```

VoiceDesign (instruction-based):

```bash
faster-qwen3-tts design \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-VoiceDesign \
  --instruct "Warm, confident narrator with slight British accent" \
  --text "Welcome to the show." \
  --language English \
  --output out.wav
```

Streaming (prints RTF after write):

```bash
faster-qwen3-tts custom \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice \
  --speaker aiden \
  --text "Hello!" \
  --language English \
  --output out.wav \
  --streaming
```

Server mode (keep model hot, stop with `exit`):

```bash
faster-qwen3-tts serve \
  --mode custom \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-TTS-12Hz-1.7B-CustomVoice \
  --speaker aiden \
  --language English \
  --streaming
```

### How it works

The CUDA graphs are unchanged — both predictor and talker graphs are replayed per step. The streaming generator yields codec ID chunks every `chunk_size` steps, and the model wrapper decodes each chunk to audio using a sliding window with 25-frame left context (matching the upstream codec's `chunked_decode` pattern) to avoid boundary artifacts.

## Voice Cloning Quality

### Cloning modes

`generate_voice_clone` exposes two modes via `xvec_only`:

| Mode | `xvec_only` | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Simple (x-vector) | `True` (default) | Speaker embedding only — shorter prefill, clean language switching, no `ref_text` needed |
| Advanced (ICL) | `False` | Full reference audio in context — requires accurate `ref_text`, may produce a brief artifact at the start |

Simple mode is the default and generally produces clean results. Advanced (ICL) mode can more closely match the reference timbre but requires an accurate transcript and sometimes has a rough start on the first word.

### Decoder context (ICL mode)

The 12 Hz codec uses a causal `chunked_decode`: each frame is reconstructed using prior frames as acoustic context. In ICL mode the reference audio codec tokens are prepended to the generated tokens before decoding, then the reference portion is trimmed from the output. Without this, the codec decoder starts cold with no voice context — the model generates the right tokens but they get reconstructed in the wrong voice. This is handled automatically.

### Non-streaming vs streaming quality

`generate_voice_clone` defaults to `non_streaming_mode=False` to match the official Qwen3-TTS behavior. You can set `non_streaming_mode=True` to put the **full target text** into the prefill before any audio is generated. This can improve prosody/consistency for non-streaming use cases, but it is not how the official demo behaves.

`generate_voice_clone_streaming` always uses `non_streaming_mode=False` — text is fed token-by-token during decode, which is the correct tradeoff for streaming since the full sentence isn't known in advance. The speed difference between the two modes is negligible (~2.3 s vs ~2.4 s per generation on RTX 4090).

### ICL Phoneme Artifact

In ICL mode the model's prefill ends with the last codec token of the reference audio, so the first generated token is conditioned on whatever phoneme the reference ends on. If the reference ends mid-word, that phoneme bleeds into the generated speech.

**The fix is applied by default.** The wrapper appends 0.5 s of silence to the reference audio before encoding it, giving the model a clean starting point regardless of how the recording ends. Set `append_silence=False` to match the upstream behavior exactly.

## Voice Cloning with Precomputed Speaker Embeddings

For production use, extract the speaker embedding once and reuse it:

```bash
# 1. Extract speaker embedding from reference audio (one-time, ~10s)
python examples/extract_speaker.py --ref_audio voice.wav --output speaker.pt

# 2. Generate speech with CUDA graphs (real-time)
python examples/generate_with_embedding.py --speaker speaker.pt --text "Hello!" --language English --output en.wav
python examples/generate_with_embedding.py --speaker speaker.pt --text "Bonjour!" --language French --output fr.wav
python examples/generate_with_embedding.py --speaker speaker.pt --text "Hallo!" --language German --output de.wav
```

The speaker embedding is a 4KB file (2048-dim bf16 vector). In `x_vector_only` mode:
- **No accent bleed**: native pronunciation per language
- **Shorter prefill**: 10 tokens vs ~80+ in full ICL clone mode
- **No ref audio at runtime**: just the 4KB embedding file
